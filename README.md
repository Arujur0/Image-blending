## Run
Execution requires to simply run the main.py file in the Code the folder. Then a series of operations has to be carried out:
  1. Select a few points to determine the patch.
  2. Move the patch around on the target image using the arrow keys.
  3. Use the A and S keyboard keys to enlarge or to shrink the size of the image.
  4. Use the R keyboard key to rotate the image counter-clockwise.
